    After dedicating 3 hours to this artwork, while fasting without water since morning, I'm thrilled to share my latest creation! Feeling a rush of joy and excitement... ðŸ”¥
    
    Every stroke in my paintings feels like a step forward. ðŸŽ¨
    
    Wishing you a Happy Mahashivaratri! May Lord Shiva shower you with happiness and blessings. ðŸ”±âœ¨
